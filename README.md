# PyOT2
PyOT2 intends to be a MMO game server framework written primarily in Python3.6+.

Base OT Protocol: 7.70 (more protocol versions might be added later on)

### Development status & goals
PyOT2 is currently in early development.
It was started in mid August of 2018 or so and is only being developed by one person currently.
The actual development takes place on and source code resides in the developer's own personal computer.
Chunks of source code will be released by the developer (e.e) in the /release directory in exchange for code contributions.

### Instructions / Directory structure
**/development:**
Code contributions by other developers goes here.
Only files/filenames that already exists in this directory are valid.
Fill the python functions up with working code to contribute and either notify me or wait for me to notice to receive your reward assuming that the code match the description in the comments and does what it's supposed to.
Or better yet contact me before-hand and we can discuss the details and make sure we avoid any misunderstandings.

**/doc:**
Files here gives basic insight into how some common components needed for development work e.g. the function names used for network handling.

**/release:**
Rewards for contributions (personal PyOT2 source code) are released here in return for contributions in /development.
